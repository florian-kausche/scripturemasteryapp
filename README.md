# ScriptureMasteryApp

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple scripture memorization application built with C#. As a software engineer, this exercise is designed to enhance my understanding of building console applications using C#. It provides a foundation for developing more complex applications using built-in C# functions and variables.

The software includes functionality for displaying scriptures, hiding words, and checking if the scripture has been fully memorized. This program helps beginners understand how to build and interact with console applications and manage data persistence.

## Purpose
The purpose of creating this software is to practice using C# for basic console application functionality. It also provides a starting point for understanding function operations within a C# application.
